##### Abstract

Power-efficiency has been an increasing design consideration in 
virtually all new silicon in the past 15 years. Power-first
designs, however, typically appear only in niche applications
such as IoT. A 2023 retrospective paper of a research lab's 2002 circuit, 
using a technique called “drowsy logic,” reviewed historical strategies to
limit leakage in the context of foundries' recent implementation of 
low-leakage FinFET and Gate-All-Around technologies. This review 
explores new research and industry applications of drowsy logic.
