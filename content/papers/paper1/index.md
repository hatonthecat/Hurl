##### Abstract

Power-efficiency has been an increasing design consideration
in virtually all new silicon in the past 15 years. Power-first1
designs, however, typically appear only in niche applications
such as IoT. A 2023 retrospective paper describing a research
lab's 2002 circuit, using a technique called “drowsy logic,”
reviewed historical strategies to limit leakage in the context of
foundries' recent implementation of low-leakage FinFET and
Gate-All-Around technologies.2,3 This review explores new
research and additional industry applications of drowsy logic.
