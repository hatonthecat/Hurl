## Introduction

This graduate course explores what a modern day gonzo journalist would cover instead of the Mint 400. Research topics include Silicon Valley and new semiconductor foundries being manufactured near Las Vegas. This question was first posed as a [thought probe](https://github.com/hatonthecat/Hurl/blob/main/static/Thought%20Probe.pdf) in October 2022.
