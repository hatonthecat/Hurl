## Introduction

This graduate course explores what a modern day gonzo journalist would cover instead of the Mint 400. Research topics include Silicon Valley and new semiconductor foundries being manufactured near Las Vegas. This question was first posed as a [thought probe](https://github.com/hatonthecat/Hurl/blob/main/static/Thought%20Probe.pdf) in October and [November](https://github.com/EI2030/Low-power-E-Paper-OS/blob/master/Remaking%20the%20Nokia%206110%20and%20Psion%20Series%203%20on%2022nm%20PDF%20pages%201-19.pdf) 2022.

##### Part 1 - Industrialized Printing Press, Xerox PARC, and World Wide Web 

Pop culture is inseparable from [technology.](https://www.rfcafe.com/miscellany/cool-videos/intel-our-rock-stars.htm) Comparisons in Commercial advertisements made 30 years [after](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibFwc4bHtFc) the Intel Pentium era. A study of of Outcault's 1895 [The Yellow Kid](https://www.tcj.com/outcault-goddard-the-comics-and-the-yellow-kid/) comic strip, the color [offset press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offset_printing),  [transistor radios ](https://www.nutsvolts.com/magazine/article/the_transistor_radio) and PARC's [Cookie Monster](https://newsteve.substack.com/p/most-ideas-come-from-previous-ideas) as prototypical tech demos.

##### Part 2 Stranger in a strange homeland and the role of individuality in a "Non-Player Character" Era

Fictional portrayals of technological and cultural obsolescence, or intentional anachronisms, are common in films such as [Enchanted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enchanted_(film)) (2007) and [An American Pickle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_American_Pickle) (2020). As early as the 1960, Hunter S. Thompson was known to make fun of counter-culture, even whilst indulging himself at [Big Sur](https://www.beatdom.com/hunter-s-thompson-gonzo-frontiersman/), made fun of disco in the 1970s, and Bill Clinton's [saxophone](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2001/02/was-clinton-cool/302110/) in the 1990s (but also [gifting him a reed](https://birdinflight.com/en/inspiration/project/20220203-chloe-sells-hot-damn.html)). There are two things that I know to be true, after studying HST on and off for nearly 20 years. The [first,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_S._Thompson#Persona) "Thompson admitted during a 1978 BBC interview that he sometimes felt pressured to live up to the fictional self that he had created, adding, "I'm never sure which one people expect me to be." and the [second](https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v20/n20/hari-kunzru/the-first-person-steroid-enhanced): 

"His seemingly perverse insistence on face-to-face confrontation occasionally exposes cant and hypocrisy. In 1964 he offers his services to President Johnson as governor of Samoa (‘My position at this time is in flux enough to allow my serious consideration of such a move’), then withdraws the offer in protest at the escalation of the war in Vietnam. Scolding LBJ (‘start acting like a thinking human instead of a senile political beast’), Thompson, at this point an obscure hack, places himself on the next metaphorical barstool to the President, insisting on his right to address the Administration as an equal. Lack of emotional engagement seems, throughout _The Proud Highway_, to be the crime which Thompson abhors. Again and again he insists that things happen because people, particular individual people, make them happen. And if you don’t like what people do, you should confront them. Applied to the smoke and mirrors world of US politics, it taps into old-fashioned American ideas about individual liberty and plain talking."

Emerging social movements, however are less equipped to deal with individuality in isolation when compared, strawman-like, to NPCs, or "non-Player (or non-Playable) Character" [stereotypes.](https://kotaku.com/how-the-npc-meme-tries-to-dehumanize-sjws-1829552261) However, the opposite is also true: organized social justice often uses a flat form of [Menippean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menippean_satire) derision (as opposed to dry wit) to mock old-fashioned ideas, pigeonholing even rugged individualism as [housecat libertarianism.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fEEbKJoNbU) The difference HST had between a modern political activist, is that HST would write personalized emails, whereas today an activist, including of my own generation, might sign a carbon-copied petition on Change.org, or use an exact template for parroting statistically representative beliefs rather than a [long tail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail) of truly diverse and protected opinions. NPC pejoratives also appear to stem from, paradoxically, from increased tolerance to extreme beliefs, such as solipsism, which libertarianism is incompatible with in groups larger than one.

##### Lecture notes

Can Americans identify Arizona on a map? Nevada? New Mexico?

Did Kurt Cobain really say "Mosquito"? or "How does he know?" And did he say, "Albino"? or "How would I know?" and "How would you know?"

##### Readings

+ [_Chaos Monkeys: Obscene Fortune and Random Failure in Silicon Valley_](https://github.com/hatonthecat/Hurl/blob/main/static/picture.jpg) – Antonio Garcia Martinez; Harper Press, 2017. This required reading covers server-side testing and culture, as well as internal company politics.

+ [_Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: A Savage Journey to the Heart of the American Dream_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_and_Loathing_in_Las_Vegas) - Hunter S. Thomas, 1971. (Whenever I get criticized for having unintelligible or meandering writing, I prefer to [remind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_S._Thompson#Writing_style) others that Hunter Thompson's [faxes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMXNwijhUq4) "became notorious for haphazardly sending sometimes illegible material to the magazine's San Francisco offices as an issue was about to go to press.")
