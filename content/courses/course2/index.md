## Introduction

Jean-Paul Sartre's influence on political philosophy shaped much of post-war France and the tenuous power sharing relationship between De Gaulle and the PCF coalition government. Some say there are two Sartres- one of his early year up to the conclusion of WWII, and  a post-war Sartre. Analysis will show a running thread of three Sartres, one of a philosopher, a critic of dialectic materialism, and an anarchist.

"Here I am referring to the notion of authenticity which forms a central axis in the works of existentialists such as Jean-Paul Sartre or Albert Camus. From the existentialist perspective life’s ‘purpose’ is to live and express oneself authentically. Though I would hazard that most people bandying about the term virtue signaler are not conscientiously channeling the ideas of Sartre, I do think this notion of authenticity lies at the heart of such accusations."

"For Sartre, the practico-inert tends to imply the alienation of subjective freedom, whereas praxis is the moment at which agency — even agency that can lead to greater political emancipation or a socialist revolution — becomes possible. Any such agency begins at an individual level and can then extend to groups. Sartre gives the example of a spontaneously forming group in the streets of Paris at the time of the storming of the Bastille in 1789. This type of group, which Sartre calls the “group in fusion,” is a moment of unalienated, intersubjective solidarity.

However, Sartre believes that on many other occasions when individuals exist in groups, the relations between them and others around them are alienated ones. They find themselves ensnared in “serial praxis,” in which the other is an obstacle rather than an aid to their freedom. Sartre gives another example of people standing in a bus queue: the presence of others further up the queue implicitly pits my freedom against that of others, as opposed to encouraging relations of reciprocity and solidarity between us."

These writings reveal Sartre's conditional leanings away from Marxism and towards the indidividual philosophy in the abstract and the praxis of anarchism. 

In my own interpretation, acting as the political scientist, his words examine individuals and groups as if they are chemicals in a beaker. Inert, non-bonding noble gases, represent the anarchist individual who does not readily undergo chemical bonding with other atoms (persons). In soluble chemistry, "a suspension is a heterogeneous mixture in which the solid particles do not dissolve, but get suspended throughout the bulk of the solvent, left floating" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(chemistry)

![image](https://github.com/hatonthecat/Hurl/assets/76194453/fbb7bae0-fea7-4568-ae6d-81550aa65fd6) The solution represents a fused-group, one that is more or less a single entity (e.g. a political party, and organization, a coordinated government, or any other group acting in unison). The suspended mixture and the precipitation both depict individual solids, the same way individual freedoms are inalienable- existence precedes essence (interpellation/objectivization/subjectivization). In practice, a bus stop might represent a precipitation, where individual freedoms are not exercised due to shared interests, but in a passively waiting state. This changes when the realization that a bus arrival is delayed and/or cancelled, causing some of the individuals to disperse/make other plans. 

An additional examination will compare _Le Mur_ (1939) "The Wall" to a time-dependent game theory. The Prisoner's dilemma, represents a similar example of decision making, but one with prescribed outcomes. As will be later described, the absurdist survival of Pablo represents Deus ex machina-like fluke of the prisoner's dilemma quadrant, one that adds multivariable to the integral f(x)= t-20(8AM), where t represents the 20 seconds prior to the deadline that the Pablo needed to wait before playing the clown, as, confessing any earlier than 20 seconds (e.g. 40 seconds), would prompt the dispatchers to arrive too early to spot Ramon arriving at the cemetery to hide, and believing they were fooled, return to carry out the sentence before Ramon hypothetically arrives at the cemetery. In that sense, the prisoners dilemma is time-sensitive. 

An indoor scenario could also be true. If both Pablo and Ramon were captured as suspects to a capital crime (e.g. being the anonymous leader of an illegal political party) that only Ramon committed, but the authorities do not yet know the perpetrator, and, not having time to coordinate their responses, they would have no way to protect the interests of the other (except listening and speaking in code through walls and plumbing). Pablo, rather than stay silent (which could result in a lesser sentence or even freedom), decides to take the blame for Ramon by confessing to an act he didn't commit, in effect, attempting to sacrifice himself as in _Le Mur_. Assume Pablo also had a deadline of a morning. In the act of waiting til the last minute, he gestures falsely that he is the leader of the illegal group, and in the procedure of carrying out the sentence, a number of journalists arrive just in time to witness and document the execution, but the added weight of the all the members - guards, press, and Pablo- in a narrow corridor exceeding maximum weight capacity on the way to an execution chamber at that precise time causes the prison, located directly above a fault line, to rupture wide open, leading to a prison riot and an escape of thousands of inmates. Ramon, who does not escape, discovers that all the guards have died from a floor collapse. The prisoners who do escape also end up causing a coup (e.g. present day Haiti), Ramon becomes a high ranking official, who pardons/commutes the sentence of Pablo. In the traditional sense, "Deus ex machina" usually represents an abrupt solution to an unsolvable problem. But for the sake of a simpler argument, assume that it only represents an event that causes an unexpected and unlikely occurrence, not an unsolvable one, and not necessarily a problem that has no other prescribed outcomes. I will call this "half-Deux", (an act of a Demi-God) for short.

https://jacobin.com/2020/04/jean-paul-sartre-communism-algeria-oppression :

"In fact, Sartre’s relations with Communism and the PCF were a lot stormier than his critics would have us believe. In the period after 1945, the intellectuals of the PCF subjected him to repeated and violent attacks, afraid that his ideas were attracting support from students and other young people whom they hoped to draw towards their own ranks. Sartre suffered far more virulent attacks from this quarter than Camus did. One book by the PCF intellectual Roger Garaudy, in which Sartre figures prominently, was called Gravediggers of Literature"

"In an article written in 1948, Sartre proclaimed his ambition to “write for his own time.” His aim was not to pursue universal truths, but to confront the reality of the world in which he lived. Its problems were too urgent to be neglected in favor of more long-term considerations." 

It is certainly true that over the next few years, Sartre made some very unwise statements in defense of the Soviet Union. But the alliance was short-lived. In 1956, when the Soviet leadership sent tanks into Hungary to crush a working-class rising, Sartre’s opposition was forthright and public, insisting that socialism “is not brought at bayonet point.” Thereafter, his criticism of the USSR became ever sharper: he condemned “Soviet imperialism,” and argued that the Soviet working classes should “take the power which has been stolen from them” by the country’s rulers."

"In Astruc’s opinion, Sartre was essentially an anarchist. Sartre admits (and says in the film), "We were, if you like anarchists, but it was a special kind of anarchy." https://ndpr.nd.edu/reviews/jean-paul-sartres-anarchist-philosophy/

https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/rene-berthier-the-supposed-anarchism-of-jean-paul-sartre

"What is anarchism?
The first thing that comes to mind when considering whether a person is anarchist is to define what anarchism is, and then to see how the person’s words and actions are consistent with the definition. In particular, one must be very careful about self-proclamation of anarchism. Anyone can believe themselves to have been an anarchist at one time or another, and such proclamations Sartre made must be taken with caution: “I was always more of an anarchist than a Marxist” or “You have to understand that my anarchism, as you call it, was really an expression of freedom, the freedom I described earlier, the freedom of a writer”.[14] In many interviews Sartre calls himself an anarchist and commentators have been careful not to contradict him, probably because it gave them copy to publish, but also because they had no competence to judge. Especially since, if one takes as a yardstick extremely eocumene and vague definitions found in dictionaries, one has no trouble fitting Sartre into the right boxes.

Most of these definitions see anarchism only as an opposition to power and the state, such as William Remley’s definition of anarchism as “a system that both opposes such things as government, authority, the state or domination, but also positively advocates voluntarism, mutuality, decentralized authority, and, most significantly, human freedom”.[15]"

"To trace anarchism back to Taoism, to the Greek philosophers of antiquity, or to the Christian sects of the Middle Ages, makes no sense. It is all very well to fight against oppression and to demand a strong power to secure oneself against it. One can fight against oppression in order to establish another form of oppression.

It is obvious that whenever men and women suffered oppression, they fought against it, but that is not enough to make them anarchists. However, among these fighters, there were undeniable precursors, such as William Godwin. To define anarchism, as Marshall does, “as one who rejects all forms of external government and the State and believes that society and individuals would function well without them” is quite inadequate. Marshall is wrong when he says that “anarchism did not suddenly appear in the nineteenth century only when someone decided to call himself an anarchist”: indeed, Proudhon once declared himself an “anarchist” (he wrote “an-archist”) and the word was later taken up by workers who identified with his thinking. That said, I don’t think it’s the best thing Proudhon did, because using the term “anarchist” to designate a political movement with a constructive project is a bit like shooting yourself in the foot. Gaston Leval said that in his time many young people unfortunately joined the anarchist movement not with reference to its political project but with the idea of “sowing anarchy” in its most vulgar sense."

"The Critique of Dialectical Reason, usually considered as an attempt to clarify the theory of Marxism, is however largely a challenge to Marxism. “In my view, the Critique must be considered rather as an anti-Marxist opus than as a great Marxist treatise as Aronson claims”[226], Betschart says again, and adds:

“Whereas in Marxist theory, classes are the prime agents of history, they are reduced to what Sartre calls ‘series’ in the Critique. Classes do not act in Sartre’s eyes; at best they form milieus. In this way, Sartre implicitly contests the Marxist idea of a revolution by the proletariat.”[227]"

Sierpiński Triangle

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle

                           Power Critique as Logarithmic and Multi-level/Hierarchical

![image](https://github.com/hatonthecat/Hurl/assets/76194453/e42b1402-cd8f-4700-b2c7-80e287b0efd2)

_"One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power."_ -1984

The Sierpiński triangle represents a way of visualizing the fused-group as existing on multiple levels, in both autonomous and inter-related levels. If one were to criticize the largest triangle in the set, it would be analogous to critiquing all civilizations and human societies across the globe, along with its individuals on the fringe of society dependency (the uncontacted or mythical lone wolf). Sartre's position, in this sense, could be siding with the second largest triangle within the main triangle, of which there are only three. From 1945-1949, the United States was the sole nuclear power, until the Soviet Union acquired and developed their first nuclear test. While the status of a nuclear power need not be equated with a superpower, this more or less defined the Cold War. Sartre's defense of the USSR could be seen in this regard up until the Hungarian Uprising, where, even though he supported Marxism in principle, could point out the flaws (the gulag and the bayonet). Thus Sartres' ability to critique a entity as oppressive was independent and orthogonal to its size, for personal responsibility applied to both individuals acting within organizations and outside of them. This appears to be one of the only ways to explain Sartre's mixed defense and critique of Marxism. He was interested in a geopolitical balance of power, as a means to allow oppression in any system to have a significant contender. In the Orwellian sense, it is to allow Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia to avoid totalitarianism or consolidation. Even though _1984_ suggests a routine cycle of enemies, it presumes a hierarchy above all three states and is fundamentally against solipsism. Anarchy, in the purely "the object of power is power" sense, is to lyse any unjust organization as if it were a cell so that its components can reconsitute itself, therefore the anarchist metamorphs between anarchist, to socialist, and even a lesser force that cycles to a sovereign to counteract a larger sovereign power, if the goal is to deconsolidate all oppressive states. Replacing one form of oppression with another could hardly be considered a recognition of personal or individual freedom. Thus supporting a cause could be considered a means to that end, although if the means or ends infringe on another's freedom, it cannot be considered a worthy cause. In the Orwellian sense, Eurasia, Eastasia, and Oceania would be broken up into an infinite number of states, equating in number to the population.

"But as a prelude to the review, have a look at the October 1948 letter above, posted originally at Letters of Note. In it, Orwell writes to his publisher Frederic Warburg, keeping him posted on the state of the manuscript of 1984. Then, at the very end, he adds that “I have just had Sartre’s book on antisemitism, which you published, to review. I think Sartre is a bag of wind and I am going to give him a good boot.”

Furthermore, from https://philosophynow.org/issues/16/Orwell_and_Philosophy 

"A few months on and Orwell found Bertrand Russell’s Human Knowledge: Its Scope and Limits no more impressive; it made him feel that philosophy should be made illegal. Orwell wrote a great deal in a relatively short space of time, and on a great many subjects, but little else that he wrote referred directly to philosophy. I suspect that he saw it as a kind of gratuitous cleverness and he had no appetite for that. In Orwell’s writings, fiction or non-fiction, there are few good intellectuals. Where they appear, then it is usually only to spin words without meaning. At best, they are inadvertently confusing; at worst, deliberately so: Marxists, for example, or nationalists or Anglo or Roman Catholics. Or Jean-Paul Sartre.

Although Orwell made few direct references to philosophy, much of his later and better writing amounts to an attempt at working out the political consequences of what are essentially philosophical questions. When and what should we doubt? When and what should we believe? Questions like these are particularly important in Nineteen Eighty-four. In that novel, the official philosophy of the fictitious Oceanian regime is a sort of global scepticism while everyday common sense has been made a heresy. It is common sense that triggers off Winston Smith’s illfated rebellion, a rebellion against the kinds of thing that put Orwell off philosophy.

“They were wrong and he was right. The obvious, the silly and the true had got to be defended. Truisms are true, hold onto that! The solid world exists. Its laws do not change. Stones are hard, water is wet, objects unsupported fall towards the earth’s centre.”

Later, therefore, when the novel describes the State’s attempts at ending Smith’s dissent, it details a process whereby common sense is undermined by sophistry and scepticism. The operation is supervised and, in its later stages, performed by O’Brien, the ruling Party’s agent provocateur. Re-educating Winston, he remarks:

_“You are here because you have failed in humility, in self-discipline. You would not make the act of submission which is the price of sanity. You preferred to be a lunatic, a minority of one. Only the disciplined mind can see reality, Winston. You believe that reality is something objective, external, existing in its own right. You also believe that the nature of reality is self-evident. When you delude yourself into thinking that you see something, you assume that everyone else sees the same thing as you. But I tell you, Winston, that reality is not external. Reality exists in the human mind, and nowhere else. Not in the individual mind which can make mistakes and in any case soon perishes: only in the mind of the Party which is collective and immortal. Whatever the Party holds to be the truth, is the truth. It is impossible to see reality except by looking through the eyes of the Party.”_

While Orwell critiqued Stalinism in its totalitarian sense, Sartre, who did not represent a life-long committment to communism, would later see his successors, the [Situationists](https://monoskop.org/images/2/24/Plant_Sadie_The_Most_Radical_Gesture_The_Situationist_International_in_a_Postmodern_Age.pdf), in May of 1968, the spirit of Absurdity- bags of wind that cruised the streets of Paris in their dérive. Their participation, was both performative and in bad faith, unwittingly, as hyperrealism engulfed the essence of [Modernity,](https://youtu.be/_g8JVK4Fppw?t=232) the classic intellectual, in the twilight hours of the 1960s.  

In "The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas," by Ursula K. Le Guin, the imprisonment of even a single disabled child cannot be considered a free society, because anarchy defines all individuals as free from oppression:

"She explored alternative political structures in many stories, such as in the philosophical short story "The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas" (1973) and the anarchist utopian novel The Dispossessed (1974)." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_K._Le_Guin

This concept can also be extended to the idea of [open individualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_individualism#History) (the idea that "there exists only one numerically identical subject, who is everyone at all times, in the past, present and future.") 

Political science can be exercised as a thought experiment, whether in a fictional novel, or in a dialectic. Hegel's dialectic is abstract. Marx attempted to bring that abstract to the material. Kierkegaard's existentialism was adopted by Sartre, and exercised both thought experiments (addressing the practico-inert) and praxis: https://blogs.law.columbia.edu/critique1313/maximilian-ringleb-existentialist-praxis-beyond-idealist-marxism-or-how-can-sartre-help-us-today/

"Sartre’s interpretation of Marx as the synthesis of Kierkegaard and Hegel, of existentialism and objective reality, sheds further light on his overarching project in Critique of Dialectical Reason. Rather than attempting to unite Marxism and existentialism as two previously isolated philosophies, Sartre aims to reclaim an existentialist Marxism that he sees first expressed in Marx himself. In the conclusion of his Search for a Method, Sartre reiterates unambiguously: “Marx’s own Marxism, while indicating the dialectical opposition between knowing and being, contained implicitly the demand for an existential foundation for the theory.”[6] In our discussion, Noreen Khawaja presented an illustrative methodological analogy of Sartre’s project as an attempt to unite dialectic thought and phenomenology. Indeed, one might argue that such an approach was first introduced by Hegel, which further supports the interpretation of Sartre’s project as a reclamation rather than an original claim."

"Realistic existentialist praxis can and should therefore do without the guidance of idealistic Marxist principles (which does not include Marx’s early works). Sartre’s notion of seriality—a rather individualist, i.e. existentialist, rather than idealist Marxist idea of organization and praxis—might be the key to an effective existentialist praxis. Sartre shows how a common situation can serially connect individuals, create a group-in-fusion, and result in an effective surpassing of the situation. These groups can then form standing organizations that use the momentum to call for broader change, or they can dissolve again into forms of seriality. Guenther rightfully notes that “in the absence of an external threat, the standing organization may produce and exacerbate internal divisions among its members … [and] become an institution that constrains and eventually undermines … agency.”[21] As long as the formation of groups and standing organizations is connected to clearly defined goals, however, Sartre’s conception of existentialist praxis seems to provide an effective basis for change while providing a maximum sphere of freedom to the individual."

https://www.jstor.org/stable/48586981#:~:text=The%20practico%2Dinert%20is%20an,organic%20inertia'%20(556).

"This article focuses on Sartre’s concept of the practicoinert in his major work A Critique of Dialectical Reason, Vol. 1 (CDR). I first show the progression from Sartre’s previous conception of in-itself to his concept of practico-inert. I identify five different layers of the practico-inert: human-made objects, language, ideas, social objects and class being. I show how these practico-inert layers form the possibilities for our subjectivity and how this represents a change from Sartre’s view of in-itself in Being and Nothingness. I then explore the relationship of freedom to the practico-inert and how Sartre argues that the practico-inert places limits on our freedom. Lastly, I argue that despite the pessimistic picture Sartre paints in CDR, the practico-inert has the potential to both limit and enhance our freedom. I appeal to Sartre’s post-CDR essay ‘A Plea for Intellectuals’ to argue that a Sartrean account of progress requires the utilisation of the practico-inert."

Camus, may have agreed more with Sartre, or Sartre may have agreed with Camus, had the former not died at an early age. They shared an interest in anarchic philosophy (Camus openly and incomprehensibly to the European press, before it became popular patchwork in the 90s), in at least that it pertained to individual freedom. But they may have differed most in their views on Algeria, in that Sartre believed more in praxis than Camus' practico-inert opposition to ending colonialism. Nonetheless, as the above CDR critique essay suggests, some mixture of the two may reflect the maximum sphere of freedom for the individual.

Situationism as a Fountain: Subversive Absurdity or Subversive Postivism? 
---
Sartre's _Being and Nothingness_ emphasizes the non-negation nothingness, and that the individual is responsible for those decisions. The Situationists' precipitation of late-stage capitalism in May of 1968 merely highlighted the role that the hyperreal individual played, but did not negate their activity to bad faith. France's enlightnment was being replaced by post-modernism, and Situationism's disappearing act was explained by its sublation into antiquity. Inasmuch Situationism serves a memserizing reminder of postmodernisms sumblimation, Sartre's disciples are allowed to fallow reflexively while accelerationist industry re-attempts its Sisyphean climb.
